JSCOM
======================
A light-weight component framework that supports NodeJS development. 
By using JSCOM, a software system is constructed as components bindings. 
It facilitates introspection of a constructed system and its 
meta-level properties at runtime, and allows this system to be reconfigured on the fly.
